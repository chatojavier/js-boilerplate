# Javascript Tailwind Boilerplate

This is my personal Javascript with Tailwind Boilerplate for using:

ES6 compiled through Babel
PostCSS
Tailwind CSS

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:
```
## Using npm
npm install

## Using Yarn
yarn
Webpack development server
```
## Webpack development server

To start up a Webpack Development Server, run the following command:
```
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using Yarn
yarn dev
```

## Production bundle

To build a production bundle run:
```
# Using npm
npm run prod

# Using Yarn
yarn prod
```
After that you will have a ready to deploy bundle at /dist.

Javascript and CSS files will be minified and stripped from unused elements.
